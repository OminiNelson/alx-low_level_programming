This is my readme file for pointers arrays and strings.
Task 0 - this will change any value in *n to 98,
     *n is telling the computer to go to the value at the address n.
Task 1 - our program in this task will take two arguements *a and *b, and it will swap their values.
Task 2 - our program uses a for loop to iterate through an array of characters or a string printing the number of iteration before getting to the \0 character, which will in return count the lenght of the string.
Task 3 - this will print out a string, this time i am using while so that i can print all the characters till \0 is found
Task 4
